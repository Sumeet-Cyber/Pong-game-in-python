# Hi there User!
The other day I was just wondering what can be done to get ride of boredom? So first I programmed my first game utilizing Pygame Library and Now I can play it wheneve I feel bored!

## Steps to run the game->
- clone the repo.
- move to the code directory
- rum the main.py file
- and that's it!

Thanks for your time and Enjoy the Game.
